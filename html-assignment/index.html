        <p> I am <strong>Gauldwin</strong> and here are a few things you might or might not be interested in knowing about myself. It might sound really weird or random but I've always related a lot to <strong>water</strong>. Yup -- <em>water</em>. Water is fluid, adaptable and able to fit into any space it enters, and I see myself the same way. I enter spaces and situations without losing my sense of self...or atleast I try haha.</p>

    <ul>
            <li> I enjoy listening to music and dancing as a way to freely express myself and stay active. </li>
            <li> On my leisure time, I love going to random places while dressing up and doing funshoots. </li>
    </ul>
        <p> This tagline represents the idea that I want to put out there through my personal brand called the,  <strong><em>BlurryMvmnt</em></strong>. It represents how I approach life -- with <em>curiosity, openness,</em> and <em>willingness to embrace uncertainty</em>. Like water, I don't limit myself to a fixed destination but instead, I allow life to just do its own thing. Being "<strong>Lost</strong>" is not always a bad thing in my opinion. Sometimes it just means being present and open to wherever life flows next. </p>
