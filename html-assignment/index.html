    <p> I am Gauldwin and here are a few things you might or might not be interested in knowing about myself. It might sound really weird or random but I've always related a lot to water. Yup--water. Water is fluid, adaptable and able to fit into any space it enters, and I see myself the same way. I enter spaces and situations without losing my sense of self...or atleast I try haha.
